# basic physics engine

a basic 2D physics engine, made for educational purposes.

currently "done":
- [ ] circles
- [ ] rectangles
- [ ] wall collision

TODO (for now):
- [ ] fix wall collision bugs
- [ ] newton's gravity (force)
- [ ] circle collision
- [ ] rectangle collision
- [ ] circle and rectangle collision
- [ ] polygons
- [ ] generalize collision between shapes
- [ ] springs
- [ ] include "soft" bodies too (compression, deformation, potential energy etc) 


## Usage
```
$ cd demos
$ python <enter the demo filename here>.py
```
